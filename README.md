# Apigee Edge Microgateway Decorator

This is a [decorator](https://github.com/guidowb/meta-buildpack/blob/master/README.md#decorators) buildpack
for Cloud Foundry that provides integration with the Apigee Edge API Management via the Edge Microgateway.

When this decorator (and the [meta-buildpack](https://github.com/guidowb/meta-buildpack))
is present in your Cloud Foundry deployment, you can selecte the 'Microgateway' service plan from the Apigee Edge service broker. With that service plan you can automatically add Apigee API Management via the Microgateway.
